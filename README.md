# Toyceptron 🧠


A real neural network, without magic or external libraries.


## 📝 Description

Toyceptron is a pure Python implementation of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP).
The project aims to demystify how neural networks work by building them from
scratch, without external libraries.

## ✅ What it does

- Creates neurons, layers, and a small network
- Runs a simple feedforward pass
- Prints raw and activated outputs

## ▶️ How to run

1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run:

```
py main.py
```

## 📁 Files

- main.py: demo and print output
- neuron.py: single neuron
- layer.py: group of neurons
- network.py: multi-layer network
- activation.py: basic activation functions

## ✍️ Notes

This is a learning project. The goal is clarity, not performance.
